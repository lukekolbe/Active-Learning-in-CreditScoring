# AL-in-CreditScoring
Active Learning in Credit Scoring – Masters Thesis Project

A benchmarking experiment using multiple Active Learning (AL) algorithms on several credit scoring datasets.
This experiment evaluates if credit scorecards improve their predictive power when being assisted by Active Learning methodology. 
The experiment is motivated by the fact that all credit scoring data is biased, because the data only contains samples who received a loan in the past: 
Since loan-granting decisions are often aided by predictive models or heuristics trying to only predict good debtors, the population of loan receivers is (increasingly) different from the population of loan applicants. Over time, this can have negative long term effects on predictive power.

The main hypotheses is that AL could help the scorecard's predictive power (generalizability) by selecting certain samples from the applicant population that the current scorecard would otherwise reject. In a round-based experiment, with loan applications being selected by both their score (based on current scorecard model) plus AL methodology, the experiment analyzes if scorecard performance improves compared to a standard model where samples are only selected by their score.

It further examines whether any improvement in predictive power is worth the risk (and thus cost) of having AL select instances the scorecard deemed bad debtors. After all, any false negative (a BAD case predicted GOOD) is very costly. Implementing AL would only then make sense in a real-world application when the gain in predictive power on future applicants offsets the increased cost of accepting potentially bad loans in the current period.


## HOW TO USE THE CODE
All files required are part of the repo, the data for the thesis was provided by the Chair of Information Systems of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Datasets include the publicly available datasets GiveMeSomeCredit (GMSC), Home Equity dataset (HMEQ), PAKDD, Australian Credit Approval (Statlog), German Credit Data (Statlog), Lendingclub. Datasets with limited availability are Thomas, UK, Bene1, Bene2.

The full code of the experiment comprises 4 code files:
- main file: AL_CreditScoring.ipynb
- parameter tuning: AL_CV.ipynb
- threshold tuning: threshold_tuner.ipynb
- result processing, plotting: result_processor.ipynb

The main file can be run without running the tuning first. For this to work, there are several secondary files required, which all also part of the repo. Namely, the tuned parameters for each model, as received from the parameter tuning file. These are stored on the folder 'metaparameters'.
Also, the file containing the tuned thresholds for each dataset is needed ('tuned_thresholds').

**It is recommended to copy all files from the repo, plus the datasets needed, into a Google Drive folder from which the code can be run via Colab. Running locally is of course possible, but will require more adjustments to file paths etc., as well slight changes to the install routine of the libraries required.**

*DISCLAIMER I: two AL-models (BMDR, SPAL) use the cvxpy library for quadratic programming. The functionality provided by cvxpy was not always stable, multiple issues with convergence and RAM usage needed workarounds, parameters need to be set carefully. Since the result data was collected in April 2022, some unknown changes to the cvxpy version installed on colab servers (or other dependencies) meant that running the code caused issues with the aforementioned models in July 2022. No changes to the code were made. After calling !pip uninstall cvxpy and then !pip install cvxpy to get the newest version, the code ran through on a Colab server in a final test on July 23rd, 2022. This is the recommended procedure. In case any issues prevail, please run the code without the two affected models.*

*DISCLAIMER II: code files are stored with examplary outputs. These are not the outputs from the actual code runs to collect results from. In order to reduce computation time, truncate outputs and save storage, the files have not been run on full specifications for their final test before submitting, e.g. not all weight options or AL-ratios. In such cases, the specs can be changed easily within the code files for extended runs if desired.*
